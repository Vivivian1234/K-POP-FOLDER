    "\n",
    "* Data Cleaning: If there are is incorrect foramtting or missing files, the system should filter them out and remove them from the bar chart until they are fixed. For example, if a user adds only one line of data for the year 2026, that line of data will not be included in the graph. A user must add 52 lines worth of data for a year for it to be registered in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Analysis: This data set should allow a mode based requirement as it sorts through the data by the popularity of the artist(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Visualisation: A Matplotlib bar chart will be used to show the comparison of different artists and their popularity in the last 13 years. The user can input a number to show only the artists and popularity for a certain year for more specific reserach. The user can type a year between 2010 and 2023, and a bar chart for that year only will appear. Users can type 'all' so all data is represented in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Reporting: The system should output a bar chart showing the most popular artist(s) in  a time frame. It should also output the most popular artist(s) under tha bar chart through a smaller dataframe. For example, a user can request the top 5 artists who are most repeated in the bar chart, and it will be shown under it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    There will be two types of data reporting, a visualised one and a dataframe one. The visualised one will show a bar graph for the corresponding conditions the user puts, with the option top # most popular songs in that group. The dataframe type will show a large dataframe instead of a bar chart for the user's personal use.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This can be beneficial for users who are trying to find the most popular artists in a certain time frame as well as in situtaions where it is hard to find the data from the bar chart directly. The red text and the bolded names can help users quickly locate something quickly for effiency.\n"

    "### *Non-functional requirements*\n",

    "\n",
    "* Reliability: This system will be reliable as it efficiently processes organised data from a dataset and turns it into an easy-to-understand bar chart. This ensures that users can trust the accuracy and consistency of the information presented, giving useful insights fort decisions. Additionally, this system is designed to handle large datasets without compromising its performance, futher proving its reliability for a wide range of uses. \n"

    "### *Purpose*\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose my my project is to clearly show and visulise data related to how popular a song or artist(s) is. This project is helpful as there is little information available online regarding the most popular k-pop songs per week, which could say a lot about the song, creator(s) and their popularity. This could encourage new and old k-pop listeners to listen to different music if, for example, a particular artist has been the most popular 3/4 weeks in a month, which could lead them to discover new genres and join new communities through music, greatly beneifiting themselves and the intergrity of this system.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this system goes public, the artists of their songs shown here may have the right to remove their song or change their band name after giving a reason, and once their reason is approved, their choice will be implemented. For instance, there are a large number of k-pop groups where a member has left after their debut. They could leave for personal reasons or because they committed a crime and was forced to leave. Groups may chnage their name to include/exclude certain names in this system. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example where an artist (A) could ask to do this could be if there is a collab song between them and anothor who has been convicted for a crime (B). Though A may have explained the situation and disagree with the B's actions, many few artists are willinging to remove their song becuase of the hard work they put in and the revenue they earned. Artists could ask to add \"**Warning: ft [ArtistName]**\" to the end of of their songs to warn listeners that they do not supported B's actions and are no longer related to them. This can clear misinformation and spread awareness for the community who may misinterpret ideas, especially if this system becomes popular. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is my responsibility to ensure that everyone can safely display information without causing any unfavourable emotions to others, whether it be discomfort or annoyance. This system should be secure so that others can not negatively affect others through it. User authentication, password hashing and encryption will be used to protect this data from people who may want to post unwanted, inappropriate or controversial messagers. If this system was to go public, users can use it as a guest mode or a login mode. Guest mode will limit the user to only be able to see all the information across the years, with no option to input variables for the system to follow, such as a specific year to analyse. Users with any account can access any year which data is recorded, and can create a copy of this system to alter or add data for their own personal use. If this system manages to get hacked, I will always have a back up version to fix everything back to normal, and I will try to stop another incident through more advanced code and finding weak connections to be fixed.\n"
